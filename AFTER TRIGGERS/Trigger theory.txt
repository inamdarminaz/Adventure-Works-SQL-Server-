"Virtual” tables for triggers: INSERTED and DELETED
SQL Server provides two virtual tables that are available specifically for triggers called INSERTED and DELETED tables. SQL Server uses these tables to capture the data of the modified row before and after the event occurs.

*DML event*		*INSERTED table holds*				*DELETED table holds*
INSERT			rows to be inserted					empty
UPDATE			new rows modified by the update		existing rows modified by the update
DELETE			empty										rows to be deleted
